For any antenna radiation measurement, a reference antenna is needed.

In this directory, you can find the layout file (GBR and DXF) to fabricate a planar sleeve dipole working at 900MHz.

You can also find the gain measurement for theta=90Â° of this antenna from 800 to 1000MHz.

The layout has to be printed on a single layer 0.4mm-thick Epoxy FR4 substrate.
