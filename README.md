# Antenna_Radiation_Measurement

Last Update : 1/02/2019

Objective : This repository integrates hardware and software for low-cost antenna radiation measurement between 800 and 950 MHz.
Two different methods with tutorial are detailed.

For measurment demo, I'm using the LoRa board presented on this github : https://github.com/FabienFerrero/UCA_Board
But this method can be adapted to any IoT device.

The first method is using the spectrum analyzer and a CW mode on the AUT

A tutorial is available here : https://github.com/FabienFerrero/Antenna_Radiation_Measurement/blob/master/Tutorial/Tutorial_Antenna_Measurement_Spectrum_2019_v1.pdf

The second method, which is less accurate, is using the RSSI of a LoRa receiver to performe the measurement
